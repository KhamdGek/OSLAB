T1-T2


pass T1 and burst time into run
head points to T2

if ( bursttime > quantum) then 
ending connects to T1
connect T1 to null
T1bursttime = 1 
end 



T2-T1

pass T2 or head into run
head points to T3
if (bursttime > quantum) then 
ending connects to T2
connect T2 to null 
T2bursttime = 1
end 


T1-T2


pass T1 into run for the specified burstime ( 1 second)
we know bursttime < quantum
T1 --> null
head points to T2
